## General Information
- EDA was done for the training dataset provided and found outliers for 'SalePrice' also there are many null values so data imputation done. Finally Used Regression model to compared the scores.
- What is the background of your project?
House Price Predictor
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
train.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- EDA analysis report is available in the py notebook
- Outliers identified for 'SalePrice' through plot and Kurtosis
- Data imputation done to treat NaN values
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
Both regression models gave similar scores on training dataset
